# Research Notes — Pre‑M6 Descriptive Gaps & Observed Market Phenomena

**Status:** Research intake closed (temporary)

**Purpose of this document**
This document consolidates all research ingested to date into a single, authoritative, non‑semantic reference. It records *what observable market phenomena recur across disparate trading frameworks* and, critically, *what descriptive capabilities the current system must possess before any decision layer (M6) can be designed*.

This is **not** a strategy document.
This is **not** a technical analysis framework.
This is a descriptive exhaustion ledger.

---

## 1. Meta‑Conclusion (Research Exhaustion Statement)

Across all ingested material — including supply/demand, orderblocks, liquidity, inducement, confirmation, momentum, reversals, candle closures, losses, moving averages, and idiosyncratic strategies — **no new irreducible observational dimensions continue to appear**.

All concepts collapse into a **finite set of descriptive axes**.

Research is therefore considered *saturated* for the purposes of primitive discovery.

---

## 2. Core Descriptive Axes (Exhaustive)

The following axes appear *universally* across all research, regardless of trading style, timeframe, or narrative.

### 2.1 Interaction

How price engages with references (levels, regions, baselines).

Observable properties:

* touch vs overlap vs traversal
* partial vs full traversal
* revisit vs first visit
* dwell time at a region
* rejection geometry (purely spatial)

No intent, strength, or meaning implied.

---

### 2.2 Absence

What does **not** occur, or what is skipped.

Observable properties:

* untraded price spans
* skipped intermediate prices
* voids between interactions
* delayed return to a region
* time‑weighted non‑interaction

Absence is a first‑class descriptive requirement.

---

### 2.3 Sequencing

The **order** in which events occur.

Observable properties:

* region A visited before region B
* boundary crossed before consolidation
* displacement preceded by / not preceded by interaction
* skipped preconditions

Order matters more than shape.

---

### 2.4 Duration

How long a state persists.

Observable properties:

* dwell duration
* exposure duration
* persistence vs transience
* revisit latency
* half‑life of interaction

Duration replaces all folk notions of “strength.”

---

### 2.5 Geometry

Relative spatial relationships.

Observable properties:

* vertical ordering of regions
* distance from extrema
* position within a larger leg
* depth vs width of interaction
* spread‑relative execution position

Purely geometric, non‑evaluative.

---

### 2.6 Finality

Distinction between provisional and settled states.

Observable properties:

* intra‑interval excursion vs interval‑final close
* wick vs body settlement
* finalized vs negated boundary interaction
* closure relative to static or rolling references

Finality is scale‑conditioned.

---

### 2.7 Cross‑Scale Visibility

The same event appears differently by aggregation.

Observable properties:

* event exists at scale X but not Y
* delayed visibility at higher scales
* fragmentation or consolidation of regions across scales

No timeframe is privileged.

---

### 2.8 Reference Types

Price interacts with different classes of references.

Observable reference objects:

* static extrema
* bounded regions (consolidations)
* rolling references (e.g., EMAs)

All are treated uniformly as *references*, not indicators.

---

### 2.9 First‑Occurrence vs Repetition

Whether a condition occurs for the first time after absence.

Observable properties:

* first satisfaction after non‑satisfaction
* repeated satisfaction
* rarity relative to local history

No implication of importance.

---

### 2.10 Interaction Degradation

How interaction changes over repeated visits.

Observable properties:

* reduced dwell time
* increased traversal
* loss of bounded overlap

Describes degradation without implying effectiveness.

---

### 2.11 Extremum Lineage & Supersession

How reference points are replaced over time.

Observable properties:

* prior extrema cease to bound price
* new extrema supersede old ones
* lineage tracking across regimes

No trend semantics.

---

### 2.12 Regime Transition Geometry

Transitional vs stabilized displacement.

Observable properties:

* mixed geometry during transition
* irregular speed and overlap
* later stabilization

Describes transition without calling it reversal.

---

### 2.13 Evidence Supersession

Later observations override earlier provisional states.

Observable properties:

* provisional event invalidated by later closure
* original observation preserved

Critical for epistemic safety.

---

### 2.14 Outcome Variance Preservation

Identical descriptive states can lead to different outcomes.

System requirement:

* preserve divergence
* never collapse to probability or expectation

This is a governance constraint.

## 3. Decomposed (Non‑Adopted) Trader Concepts

The following concepts were repeatedly encountered but deliberately *not adopted*. They are listed here only to show coverage completeness.

| Folk Concept         | Decomposed Into                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Supply / Demand      | consolidation → displacement → retest geometry    |
| Orderblocks          | interaction density + absence + visit history     |
| Liquidity            | extremum clustering + interaction accumulation    |
| Inducement           | region ordering + skipped preconditions           |
| Momentum             | displacement speed + duration + continuity        |
| Confirmation         | closure finality + scale conditioning             |
| Reversal             | extremum lineage reordering + transition geometry |
| Support / Resistance | repeated interaction + degradation                |
| Vector candle        | first‑occurrence + geometry rarity                |
| EMA strategies       | rolling reference interaction + distance          |

No semantic labels retained.

## 4. Explicit Non‑Goals (Hard Constraints)

The system will **never**:

* predict
* rank
* score
* label importance
* infer intent
* collapse to probability
* embed strategy logic in memory

Any future violation invalidates the project.

---

## 5. Current Status

* Research intake: **paused / saturated**
* M1–M5: complete and frozen
* Next phase: **Candidate Primitive Admissibility Ledger**
* M6: design only, not implementation

---

## 6. Closing Statement

This research corpus demonstrates that discretionary trading knowledge is not infinite — it is *compressed*.

The task ahead is no longer discovery, but **formalization without semantic leakage**.

Memory must remain neutral.
Decision must remain external.

This document is the authoritative research consolidation for all subsequent work.
