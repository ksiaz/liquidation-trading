# Research Notes — Pre‑M6 Descriptive Gaps & Observed Market Phenomena

**Status:** Context Preservation Document
**Scope:** Research ingestion only (no primitives finalized, no strategy logic)
**Applies to:** Memory‑Centric Market Observation System (M1–M5 frozen, M6 pre‑design)

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document consolidates **research observations posted so far** into a neutral, descriptive record. Its role is to:

* Preserve contextual knowledge across sessions
* Prevent re‑derivation of already explored ideas
* Act as reference material during **descriptive primitive formalization**
* Explicitly avoid interpretation, strategy, or evaluative language

Nothing in this document is executable logic.
Nothing here authorizes decisions, thresholds, or signals.

---

## 2. High‑Level Research Themes Ingested

The following thematic areas were explored via external trading education material. All intent and strategy framing were discarded; only **observable phenomena** are retained.

### 2.1 Price Consolidation and Displacement

Observed repeatedly:

* Short‑duration price compression
* Followed by rapid directional displacement
* Displacement often occurs without dense intermediate interaction

Limitations exposed:

* No way to describe **absence of interaction** inside displaced spans
* No neutral vocabulary for skipped price levels

---

### 2.2 Nested Structure Across Time Aggregations

Observed:

* Larger aggregation windows obscure internal structure
* Lower aggregation windows reveal:

  * additional extrema
  * multiple consolidation sub‑regions
  * varied interaction density

Limitations exposed:

* No way to describe **relative position of sub‑structure** inside a parent structure
* No neutral cross‑scale context descriptor

---

### 2.3 Boundary Excursions Beyond Prior Extremes

Observed:

* Price sometimes moves beyond a previously observed high or low
* Post‑excursion behavior varies:

  * rapid re‑entry
  * prolonged occupation
  * further continuation

Limitations exposed:

* Cannot describe **excursion depth, duration, and re‑entry latency** without semantic labels

---

### 2.4 Repeated Interaction With the Same Price Region

Observed:

* Some bounded price regions are revisited multiple times
* Interaction characteristics change across visits:

  * dwell time
  * reaction magnitude
  * traversal likelihood

Limitations exposed:

* No descriptor for **visit count**, **visit order**, or **visit spacing**
* No way to record change in interaction profile without evaluative terms

---

### 2.5 Region Traversal After Prior Interaction

Observed:

* Regions previously interacted with may later be:

  * partially crossed
  * fully crossed
  * crossed abruptly after gradual interaction

Limitations exposed:

* No neutral description of **how** traversal occurred
* No distinction between partial overlap and full cross

---

### 2.6 Sparse Interaction Between Regions

Observed:

* Price often moves between historically active regions
* The spans between them may show:

  * low execution density
  * delayed revisit

Limitations exposed:

* Inability to describe **interaction voids** between regions

---

### 2.7 Temporal Exposure and Duration Effects

Observed:

* Time spent:

  * inside regions
  * beyond extrema
  * between regions
    materially differs across events

Limitations exposed:

* System is snapshot‑biased
* No time‑weighted exposure descriptors

---

### 2.8 Directional Asymmetry Without Semantics

Observed:

* Bid‑side and ask‑side activity may differ within the same interval
* Upward vs downward displacement may differ in:

  * speed
  * depth
  * interaction density

Limitations exposed:

* No neutral asymmetry descriptors without directional bias

---

### 2.9 Cross‑Scale Context Drift

Observed:

* Local movements may conflict with broader aggregation context
* Alignment and divergence vary temporally

Limitations exposed:

* No descriptor for **cross‑scale agreement or disagreement** without narrative framing

---

### 2.10 Time‑Conditioned Market States

Observed:

* Certain clock‑time windows show altered market behavior

  * spread expansion
  * depth thinning
* Scheduled external events coincide with atypical volatility

Limitations exposed:

* No neutral way to record **time‑conditioned microstructure states**
* No exogenous event proximity markers

---

## 3. Explicitly Rejected Concepts (Recorded for Boundary Safety)

The following appeared in research sources but are **not admissible** and are **not adopted**:

* supply / demand (as semantics)
* liquidity sweep
* reversal / continuation
* confirmation
* bias
* narrative
* signal
* failure / strength / weakness
* trade execution logic
* risk‑reward framing

These terms motivated descriptive gaps but do not exist in the system.

---

## 4. Role of This Document Going Forward

This document:

* Anchors collective memory of explored research
* Serves as input for the **Candidate Structural Primitives — Admissibility Ledger**
* Prevents re‑introduction of semantic or strategic leakage
* Is read‑only context, not a design authority

Primitive definition, layer placement, and governance rules are handled **elsewhere**.
