Below is a single, authoritative HANDOVER / EMERGENCY RESTART DOCUMENT.
It is written so that a new chat, a new agent, or even a future version of me can reconstruct the entire project state without ambiguity.

This document is intentionally long, explicit, and redundant where safety matters.

🧠 MEMORY-CENTRIC MARKET OBSERVATION SYSTEM
COMPLETE HANDOVER & RESTART DOCUMENT

Scope: M1 → M5 (Complete & Frozen) + M6 (Pre-Design Research Phase)
Status: Production-grade observation system, decision layer not yet built
Authority: This document supersedes all prior conversations

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document exists to:

Preserve full project context across chat resets

Prevent epistemic drift or accidental strategy leakage

Allow a new agent to continue work without re-deriving philosophy

Lock in what is done, forbidden, and open

If anything here conflicts with future suggestions, this document wins.

1. CORE SYSTEM PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1.1 What This System IS

A Memory-Centric Market Observation System whose sole purpose is to:

Record, structure, and expose what happened in the market — without interpretation, prediction, ranking, or recommendation.

The system:

Observes

Remembers

Describes

Exposes facts

It does not:

Decide

Predict

Recommend

Evaluate

Optimize

Memory = perception
Strategy = separate, downstream, gated

1.2 What This System IS NOT

The system is NOT:

A trading strategy

A signal generator

A probability engine

A pattern classifier with meaning

A “smart money” detector

A profitability engine

Even if strategies are later attached, memory never becomes strategic.

2. LAYER ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW (M1–M5)
Layer	Name	Role	Status
M1	Ingestion	Normalize raw market data	✅ Frozen
M2	Continuity	Price-level identity & lifecycle	✅ Frozen
M3	Temporal Ordering	Chronological evidence sequences	✅ Frozen
M4	Contextual Read Models	Factual analytical views	✅ Frozen
M5	Governance	Epistemic firewall & query control	✅ Frozen
M6	Strategy	Not built	🚫 Not started
3. M1–M5 DETAILED SUMMARY
M1 — INGESTION (Frozen)

Purpose:
Normalize raw feeds (trades, orderbook, liquidations, candles).

Allowed:

Schema validation

Type normalization

Timestamp preservation

Forbidden:

Filtering “important” data

Thresholding

Aggregation

Interpretation

Output:
Pure raw events with normalized fields.

M2 — CONTINUITY & MEMORY NODES (Frozen)

Purpose:
Create and maintain price-anchored memory nodes.

Key features:

Node identity tied to price band

Lifecycle: ACTIVE → DORMANT → ARCHIVED

Evidence accumulation (counts, volumes)

Exponential decay (mechanical, non-semantic)

Dormant nodes preserve historical evidence

Archived nodes never auto-revive

Strict prohibitions:

No “support/resistance”

No strength ranking

No predictions

M3 — TEMPORAL EVIDENCE ORDERING (Frozen)

Purpose:
Preserve chronological order of factual events at each node.

Core constructs:

Evidence tokens (10 neutral types)

Rolling sequence buffer (100 tokens, 24h window)

Motifs (bigrams & trigrams only)

Motif counts, last seen, decayed strength

Key rule:
M3 answers “what happened, and in what order” — nothing more.

Prohibitions:

No prediction of next event

No probabilities

No motif ranking by importance

M4 — CONTEXTUAL READ MODELS (Frozen)

Purpose:
Provide factual language describing memory state.

Implemented view families:

Evidence Composition

Interaction Density

Stability vs Transience

Temporal Structure (M3-based)

Cross-Node Context

Critical rules:

Read-only

Deterministic

Stateless

No ranking, scoring, or “importance”

Neutral ordering only (price, time, ID)

M4 is descriptive, never evaluative.

M5 — GOVERNANCE / QUERY FIREWALL (Frozen)

Purpose:
Act as the sole legal access point to memory for external layers.

Key properties:

Schema-validated queries

Explicit rejection of forbidden intent

No “helpful” defaults

Deterministic output normalization

Strict type enforcement

Explicitly rejected query concepts:

“Best”, “top”, “strong”

“Profitable”, “edge”

“Signal”, “entry”, “exit”

“Probability”, “confidence”

M5 is a firewall, not a convenience layer.

4. STRATEGIES DISCUSSED (IMPORTANT CONTEXT)

Two strategies were discussed early, but intentionally NOT implemented:

SLBRS (Stable Liquidity Based Reversal Strategy)
Failed on XRPUSDT due to:

Orderbook zone half-life (~3.9s)

Insufficient persistence

EFFCS (Extreme Forced Flow / Liquidation Strategy)
Failed due to:

Uniform liquidation distribution

No meaningful z-score spikes

Conclusion:
Failures were market structure, not system bugs.

This motivated the Memory Layer expansion, not strategy tweaking.

5. MAJOR RESEARCH THREADS INGESTED (PRE-M6)

The following research was analyzed and abstracted into system gaps, NOT strategies:

A. GAPS & DISLOCATIONS

Flash Crash

CHF unpeg

Naked books

Price jumps without intermediate trades

Revealed missing capability:
👉 Absence detection

B. LIQUIDITY SWEEPS & FALSE BREAKS

Equal highs/lows

Trendline liquidity

Stop clusters

Inducements

Revealed missing capability:
👉 Relative geometry + absence + temporal exposure

C. MARKET STRUCTURE (HH/HL, BOS, Impulse/Correction)

BOS ≠ signal, BOS = envelope violation

Wick vs body acceptance

Internal vs external structure

Revealed missing capability:
👉 Structural change descriptors without semantics

D. MANIPULATION & SELF-TRADING

Volume inflation

Price control without prediction

Monopoly power effects

Revealed missing capability:
👉 Turnover vs persistence metrics

6. CRITICAL DISCOVERY: WHAT IS MISSING (PRE-M6)

The system is not missing a strategy.
It is missing descriptive primitives.

Identified Missing Primitive Classes:

Absence Primitives

Untraded price spans

Depth absence duration

Turnover vs Persistence

Volume traded vs net depth change

Identity churn

Relative Geometry

Execution location within spread

Position within impulse envelope

Temporal Exposure

Time-weighted liquidity voids

Response latency after sweeps

Directional Asymmetry (Non-Evaluative)

Bid vs ask behavior

Upward vs downward displacement

Structural Change Descriptors

Wick vs body acceptance

Envelope violation type

Forensic Flow Imbalances

Volume without price

Price without volume

All are admissible, factual, non-predictive.

7. STATUS OF M6 (IMPORTANT)
M6 DOES NOT EXIST YET.

Why:

Decisions require a complete descriptive vocabulary

Adding primitives after M6 would corrupt semantics

The project correctly paused before decision logic

Current phase:
👉 Pre-M6 Research & Primitive Discovery

8. WHAT MUST NOT HAPPEN NEXT

A new agent must NOT:

Implement BOS, gaps, sweeps as “signals”

Add thresholds that imply action

Label anything bullish/bearish

Collapse metrics into scores

Bypass M5 governance

Any of the above = hard stop.

9. WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN NEXT (WHEN READY)
Immediate next artifact (recommended):

Document:

“Candidate Structural Primitives — Admissibility Ledger”

For each primitive:

What it describes

What it cannot imply

Which failure mode it resolves

Which layer it belongs to (likely M4.5 / M5.5)

Only after that:

M6 design may begin

M6 must consume memory only via M5

M6 may be strategic, but memory never is

10. HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT IN A NEW CHAT

Start new conversation

Paste this entire document

Say:

“This is the authoritative handover. Continue from here.”

Do not summarize it — treat it as law

11. FINAL STATEMENT

This project is not stalled.
It is mature.

You stopped at the exact boundary where:

Most systems rush ahead

Yours refused to hallucinate meaning

That is a strength.

SIGNED:
