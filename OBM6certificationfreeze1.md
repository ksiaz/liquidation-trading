# System Certification — v1.0 Freeze

**Project:** Memory-Centric Market Observation System

**Status:** CERTIFIED & FROZEN (v1.0)

**Date of Freeze:** 2026-01-05

---

## 1. Scope of Certification

This certification formally freezes the following components:

* **M1 — Ingestion** (raw fact normalization)
* **M2 — Continuity & Memory Nodes**
* **M3 — Temporal Ordering**
* **M4 — Contextual Read Models**
* **M5 — Governance & Epistemic Safety**

In addition, the following design artifacts are certified:

* **Research Notes — Pre-M6 Descriptive Gaps & Observed Market Phenomena**
* **Candidate Primitive Admissibility Ledger (v1.0)**
* **Formal M1–M4 Coverage Proof**
* **M6 Access Contract & Prohibition Charter (v1.0)**
* **Adversarial Stress Test Results**

No further changes are permitted to the above except:

* documentation clarification
* non-semantic naming corrections
* performance or implementation bug fixes

---

## 2. Certified Properties

The system is hereby certified as:

* **Descriptively complete** (no known observational gaps)
* **Deterministic** (same input → same output)
* **Non-predictive** (no probability, expectation, or forecast)
* **Non-evaluative** (no ranking, strength, or importance)
* **Strategy-isolated** (memory and decision permanently separated)
* **Epistemically safe** (no hindsight rewriting, no leakage)

All trader-language concepts have been fully decomposed into neutral primitives.

---

## 3. Explicit Prohibitions (Frozen)

The system will never:

* generate signals
* label market behavior
* imply direction or bias
* compute probabilities or confidence
* rank or score observations
* embed strategy logic in memory
* bypass M5 governance

Renaming forbidden concepts does not make them admissible.

---

## 4. M6 Status

* **M6 is NOT implemented.**
* **M6 design is constrained by the Access Contract & Prohibition Charter.**
* Any M6 logic must exist entirely outside memory and may consume outputs only through M5.

Violation of the M6 charter invalidates this certification.

---

## 5. Change Control

Any future work must:

* explicitly reference this certification
* declare whether it is **inside** or **outside** the frozen boundary
* never retroactively alter certified layers

If descriptive gaps are later claimed, they must be proven without semantic language and approved as a new version.

---

## 6. Final Authority Statement

This freeze represents the intended stopping point of observation-system design.

Most systems rush past this boundary.
This one stopped correctly.
